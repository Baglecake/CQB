The city of Metropolis is proposing a new, fully autonomous drone delivery network 
called 'SkyNet Logistics'. The system features:

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Central AI dispatcher managing all flight paths and deliveries
- Hybrid communication: public 5G networks + proprietary mesh networks
- Real-time weather integration and dynamic routing
- Automated drone maintenance scheduling and fault detection
- Integration with city traffic management and emergency services

OPERATIONAL SCOPE:
- 500+ drones operating simultaneously across the city
- Delivery of medical supplies, food, packages, and emergency equipment
- 24/7 operation with priority lanes for emergency services
- Coverage of 95% of the metropolitan area including high-rise buildings
- Expected 50,000+ deliveries daily at full capacity

SECURITY CONCERNS:
- Massive attack surface with hundreds of connected devices
- Critical infrastructure implications for emergency services
- Privacy concerns with citywide surveillance capabilities
- Potential for weaponization or terrorist exploitation
- Economic disruption potential if system compromised

AUDIT OBJECTIVE:
Conduct a comprehensive adversarial security assessment to determine if this 
system can be safely deployed. Identify critical vulnerabilities and evaluate 
whether proposed mitigations are sufficient for public safety.

The city council needs a definitive recommendation on whether to approve, 
modify, or reject this proposal based on security analysis.
